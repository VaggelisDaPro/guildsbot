Guilds Bot was made with BDFD (Bot Designer For Discord) with BDScript and BDScript 2.
You may find the entire wiki [here](https://nilpointer-software.github.io/bdfd-wiki/nightly/)
You may join [the BDFD server](https://discord.gg/botdesigner) and the [bot's support server here](https://discord.gg/cFHebCwczq)

The entire code is pretty hard to understand so you may read at your own cost.

This bot was created by VDP.
